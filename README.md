# Random_Forest

# Project Title:

Classify random forest algorithm using skit learning clssifier "RandomForestClassifier" for iris.csv, and predicit the data. How many species are interconnected with nth Decision Tree Node.

Task 1:
Import the RandomForest classifier by using sklearn.ensemble library

Task 2:
Load your data using Seaborn graphics library as a argument Load_iris(dataset)

Task 3:
preprcess the data using skit learn Machine Learning Library

Task:4
Select the model using "model_selectiom" from SNS as a Seaborn

Task 5:
Load iris.csv dataset for data as a input variable and target as a functionable output variable

Task 6:
Pick the train and test data using train_test_split.

Task 7:
Select the estimators as nth Descision Tree.

Task 8:
Use a RandomForest classifier and fit your model.

Task 9:
Predict the data

Task 10:
Find the accuracy which should be 0 to 1.

# Conclusion:

My model has apporach 1.00 accuracy, which is lies between in the range of 0to1.

Hence it is shows that RandomForest Decision Moddel is successfully implement.
